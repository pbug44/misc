This is research on recovering the key given a plaintext crib "plaintext", such
as "GET /long/url HTTP/1.1"
    01234567890123456     <--- you get my drift.

I wrote this in order to crack my own youtube captures that I've been saving.

So you're guessing the plaintext, and have the ciphertext.  You don't know 
the key but that cracking will take a bit of time on limited resources.

Most webservers reply with the same Header to a HTTP request.  And most
web clients have a guessable GET or string within the first 16 blocks of
AES128.  If you're getting "GET / HTTP/1.1\n" that's the first 16 bytes of
the first block.  So entirely guessable.  

As mitigations a webmaster can perhaps make random URLS to lengthen the first
block and make it less guessable?

If this can crack AES on an Ampere Altra core in 30 min.  Then cracking on
a rented Ampere Altra cloud server at Hetzner with 128 cores utilized will
cost less than a cent per minute, running for an hour.  Compare that with
cracking enigma in 13 minutes on 2000 droplets on Digital Ocean, for $7.

I say gosh!
