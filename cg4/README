This is research on recovering the key given a plaintext crib "plaintext", such
as "GET /long/url HTTP/1.1"
    01234567890123456	  <--- you get my drift.

I wrote this in order to crack my own youtube captures that I've been saving.

So you're given the plaintext, and the ciphertext.  You don't know the key
but that cracking will take a bit of time on limited resources.
