A scientific effort to prove AES256 is weak.

Hypothesis:

	AES256 is broken in a near-complexity of 2 ^ 128

Work:

A demonstration for someone who wanted me to test a cipher as proof that
the given t0-t3 values and cipher and plain the key is recoverable.

The work is not done yet but this is just a commit so I don't lose this work.
I still feel it can be done but I'm not done yet.  Hoping to inspire others
to join the effort (please give me credit on your papers if you are inspired).

Basically what we can do with a partial AES-256 key (we have 128 bits because
we have the ciphertext), given the tX values we try to staircase our way up
with the modified for AES-256 inverse_function2.  it reaches until round 6.
So what to do?  Then I had the idea that we can mirror and flip the rkey's and
approach it from the other side.  Eventually the two will meet and carry over
the states.  I stopped partially with that as I had another idea of deciphering
the remaining 128 bits of key which is proven with inverse_function2 when
we recover it.  So far there is hardly any cycles needed yet.  I do this work
on a RPI 4b.

Also notice the extension from the mirror image into "pivots" (5 of them) that
will help us seperate the axis's and "cheat" around a little bit.

I've been fighting my own demons who want to sidetrack and confuse me along the
way.  What it reminds me of is this picture I once saw of a monk who copies the
testament and behind him is a demon who tries to confuse him and tortures him.
Oh well.  Life isn't easy, and programming means a lot of work.  Especially
this my original vision grew in code and I'm not done yet but I think it's
possible with a capital P.

Here is the demo program output of how the (extended) rk table looks like when
flipped through the spoon (I called that function so, because when you look in
a spoon you're upside down).

On round 7 you can see the pivot line very well, this is after running
rijndaelEncryptSetup() which I called mod() over it.  Anyhow study my code if
you dare.  If you are a newbie with code I wouldn't recommend it.  But go ahead
we were all newbies at one point.

Read the comments in the code and the commit comments for more clues.

Conclusion:
	TBD

Aftermath if proven true:
	Surely cryptographers are working in the thousands in the "west".  I'm
just a dummy, so imagine what greatness someone smart can achieve.  It is my
opinion that we must examine this cipher seriously and look for alternatives if
broken.

I personally have already switched to Chacha20-PolyXXXX for my encryption,
although I have never looked at this.  Also my security products don't allow
an IKE key exchange of non-AES/DES so I may have to go to a static key for
IPSEC.  There is people that will abuse this, so if proven broken, noone's
Wifi is secure, even if encrypted.  And all I wanted was to break my own 
youtube videos, that I've been saving for the Quantum processor era.

It is our right, as citizens of this globe to have security, even from our
governments.  It's called privacy.

Also, breaking AES may shatter ill dreams for war to start.  If Enigma break 
shortened the war by 4 years, this should delay a war by at least 4 years until
another generation of cipher is released.  Best luck to all of you!


Aftermath if proven false:
	Things go on as always.  Carry on.  Another attack will happen on the
cipher some other time.
