sipdiv.c is a small sip proxy that tries to compress (if specified with -c)
an AVM fritzbox (because I didn't find the knob in fritz!OS to turn that on).
Savings by compressing the Headers into SDP is about 70 bytes which is savings
enough to fit the dang UDP packet through a wireguard tunnel without 
fragmenting.  Because guess what?  Fritz!OS does not reassemble SIP fragments.

I had to add this line to my pf.conf for this to work:

pass in on vlan23 inet proto udp from any to 192.168.178.1 port 5060 divert-packet port 22222

Cheers!
